# About me

Hi, I'm Evan. I'm an engineer and developer from Washington, DC.

My passions:

- Cycling and bike maintenance
- Programming - [GitHub profile](https://github.com/evanbubniak)
- Language learning - I keep a Reddit profile for [write streaks](https://old.reddit.com/user/ebubsy/submitted/) and write posts in multiple languages on this site
- Cooking, especially in a rice cooker
- Urban planning, particularly low-impact, low-car living

I'm currently looking for remote software development opportunities, particularly in web development, automation, and machine learning. My most up-to-date resume is available in PDF form [here](/assets/resume.pdf).
