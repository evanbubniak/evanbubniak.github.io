Particularly on language exchange apps, I'm often asked why I learn such-and-such language in particular, whether it's French, Danish, Cantonese, Japanese or another one. Sometimes there is a story or some life history associated with my interest in a language, but these do not suffice to explain why I am such a passionate learner - they are often more like "excuses" to learn.
