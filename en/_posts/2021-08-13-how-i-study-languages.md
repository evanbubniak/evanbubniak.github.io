I study a lot of natural languages; as of August 2021, I have studied French and German for about 6.5 years; Spanish for 6 years; Mandarin for 4 years; Italian for 2 years; Cantonese and Japanese for 1.5 years; and Danish and Polish for 1.5 months. I actively maintain all of these languages and habitually seek to expand my active and passive vocabulary in all of them.

While this is a large, time-intensive personal undertaking, it is not a stressful or miserable one. On the contrary, I have persisted so long and learned so much because I greatly enjoy it. I'm often asked how I learn languages, so I wrote this post to provide a detailed answer.

There is much to recommend language learning. Much like programming, the lower bound on cost is practically zero, and for commonly spoken languages, there is an abundance of free resources and tools for pursuing your learning. However, also like programming, it takes patience, discipline, and reasonable expectations to achieve the best results.

I cannot claim it is the best methodology, or that it will work for everyone. However, I think my method contains the broad strokes of what works. I have a strict rule on not buying any resources, so the full methodology I describe is free, though many services offer paid tiers.

Those broad strokes are the following, no matter what the language is:

- Start aggressively with vocabulary and grammar. The sooner you are reading sentences, the better. The goal of the early-stage drills is to ramp up as quickly as possible to intelligently interacting with native-level material.
- Seek to understand everything about the sentences you read, and express yourself at the highest level of articulation that you can. When practicing with others, experiment frequently, trying out syntax that may be wrong and learning from your interlocutor's corrections.
- Build a diverse portfolio of target-language media that is personal to your interests. For me, that means podcasts, news broadcasts, live streams, music, video games, comics, blogs, and most importantly, friends.

Conspicuously absent from my strategy is classes, tutors, and textbooks. I find my language learning does not benefit in a classroom setting; to my shame, I learned significantly more from goofing off on WhatsApp and reading Le Monde during my French classes than I learned from paying attention to the teacher. Furthermore, I believe that graded activities like quizzes and exams often lead students to engage in what German speakers viscerally refer to as "[Bulimielernen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Bulimielernen)" - bulimia learning - where one studies in short, intense spurts with the short-term goal of performing well on their exam. I enjoy much more when my learning is self-directed, and my progress speaks for itself and provides me satisfaction when I hold interesting conversations or follow interesting content.

## Methodology

The sites and applications I use regardless of language are:

- Anki
- Wikipedia
- Wiktionary
- Tandem
- Memrise

I sometimes use Duolingo, but it is like the first stage of a multi-stage rocket; it is very useful for getting off the ground, but you should jettison it once it no longer serves you. Typically I abandon Duolingo a few weeks after finishing the tree for any given language. I have also slowly lost interest in Duolingo over the years; subjectively, I feel like the learning experience has been declining and the number of distractions has been growing, especially on mobile.

### Stage 1: Drinking from a vocabulary fire hose

This stage takes about 3 months, but can vary depending on the target language, and my time commitment.

When I start learning a language, I usually begin with [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/). It is free, and has first-party courses for almost every language I've studied. It lacks first-party Cantonese courses, but user-created courses fill the niche. This is where I spent the overwhelming majority of my early-stage learning. I work through Memrise courses and diligently create an Anki deck in parallel using the courses; this way I keep the vocabulary in regular practice after I stop using Memrise for that language. I also add any sample sentences from Wiktionary as well as any definitions or grammatical information that was missing from Memrise.

### Stage 2: Getting familiar with native content

This stage takes about 6 months. This point requires the most patience and effort, because I am jumping to dealing with native-level content at a time when I am not yet accustomed to it. So I spend a lot of time looking up vocabulary, confusedly trying to parse out sentences, trying to determine the base form of some inflected words and so on.

This is the beginning of the open-world portion of the language learning adventure. At this point I slowly acquire a collection of forums, music, language partners, news sources, and other forms of media.

#### Forums/subreddits

Examples include:

- Danish: /r/Denmark, /r/dkfinance
- French: /r/france
- German: /r/de, /r/satire_de_en, /r/HeuteLernteIch, /r/FragReddit, /r/einfach_posten, /r/Wissenschaft, /r/de_IT
- Italian: /r/italy, /r/ItalyInformatica
- Spanish: /r/es, /r/mexico
- Mandarin: /r/China_irl
- Polish: /r/Polska

I've yet to find a subreddit using vernacular Cantonese, so I use [LIHKG](https://lihkg.com/).

I rarely post on these subreddits, but I thoroughly read linked articles and comments, as these subreddits serve as a feed of native-language content, with posts usually in formal language and comments usually in informal language, about generally interesting topics.

As I'm reading, I diligently search and record new vocabulary, and study any unfamiliar grammar. I also consult grammar resources during this time; for instance, I used the [allsetlearning grammar wiki](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/) for Chinese grammar, and [Imabi](https://www.imabi.net/) for Japanese. There are language-specific quirks that can make this easier or harder; for instance, determining the correct reading of a Japanese kanji can sometimes be frustratingly difficult. If you are learning Chinese or Japanese, look for a popup dictionary browser extension; I use [zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen) for Chinese and [rikaikun](https://github.com/melink14/rikaikun) for Japanese.

#### Tandem

Once I have a strong vocabulary and grammar base, and some experience reading native-level content, I start looking for language partners on [Tandem](https://www.tandem.net/), which is a language exchange site. If you speak English, you can find users who speak your target language and are learning English, and spend some time practicing each other's language.

As I live in the United States and have close-to-zero opportunities to practice other languages in the course of my day-to-day life, Tandem is the centerpiece of my active language practice. It has built-in utilities for correcting others' mistakes in text, and having them correct you. The community is also generally friendly; I have used the app since early 2017 and can count the number of bad experiences I've had on one hand.

The mechanics for using Tandem effectively are complicated, as Tandem is structured similarly to a dating site, letting you browse around individual profiles and start hitting up people who seem interesting. It takes two to tango - the other person has to want to talk to you as well - and there's no closed form solution for really hitting it off with the people you talk to. Over the years though, I've made lots of great friends, some of whom I met in person.

#### Shows

[Viki](https://www.viki.com/) has a lot of Asian dramas, so I use it to find shows in Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese. I don't typically watch European shows, but if you happen to be subscribed to a streaming service like Netflix that carries them, then the marginal cost of watching target-language series is zero.

#### Word mining

It's frequently useful, for topics you particularly like, to find related articles on Wikipedia or other wikis in your target language and mine them for useful vocabulary.

An example: thanks to the drama and volatility in financial markets of the past couple years, I've taken an interest in their mechanics and developments. Some research suggests the two most common Chinese translations for "call option" are 看漲期權 (lit. "bullish dated right") or 看漲選擇權 (lit. "bullish right-to-choose"), so I find the corresponding [MBALib article](https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E7%9C%8B%E6%B6%A8%E6%9C%9F%E6%9D%83) and mine it for similar financial terms. Within the article I can find technical terminology, such as 有效期內 (during the period of validity), 佣金 (commission on a trade), 市價 (market value), 到期日 (date of expiry), 期貨合約 (futures contract), and so on. Consequently I put these terms into Anki, optionally tagging them as financial terms, and move on. Doing this consistently makes it possible to follow other financial news, or speak intelligently about financial topics with the people I meet.

### Stage 3: Stage 2, but without the pain

By the end of 12 months, I am in the habit of doing things I enjoy in the target language, with increasingly less friction and overhead. By this point I have at least a couple long-term language partners that I've met through Tandem, a large Anki deck with lots of vocabulary and sample sentences, YouTube channels and news broadcasts that I regularly follow, and podcasts that I listen to when I'm out and about. So long as I am consistently doing *something*, and my activities in the target language are diversified across topics and formats, I make slow and consistent progress and my ability to express myself on any arbitrary topic improves. In this way, I take advantage of my existing impulses to surf around the Internet and use them productively to learn new vocabulary.

It is important to note that I don't feel I'm ever truly done learning the language. The frequency of new vocabulary ebbs and flows, and spikes strongly when I dive into technical topics. However, the amount of overhead I need to remain proficient in a language levels off with time.

A useful side effect of learning the language is also learning the culture; as you get familiar with native speakers of the language, you come to understand new things about other communities, such as how their educational system functions, what idioms and proverbs native speakers grow up hearing, what the political situation is around the world, and so on.
