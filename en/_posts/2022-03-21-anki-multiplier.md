The effectiveness of an SRS study routine depends on a lot of variables, such as:

- under what conditions you choose to create a card
- what information you put in the card
- how you display the card
- when you practice
- how often you practice
- for how long you practice

You can condense these into "quality" and "consistency", which are more or less the key to any other routine. There is another major one that people often overlook with SRS, which is, "what other methods you use when you aren't reviewing."

My experience is that SRS is most effective when you are using it to codify and reinforce material that you've already encountered in another context. That is, SRS does not replace any other method; rather, it makes any other method you use more effective.

If an analogy would be helpful, compare it to stretching before and after a workout. Stretching doesn't replace the workout, rather, it improves your performance during the workout, then helps you recover and grow stronger afterward. Stretching primes you for a good workout and the workout primes you for a good stretch. Similarly, if you are learning a language, a good Anki routine will improve your command of the language while engaging with native-level content and speaking with others in the language, which in turn primes you to learn better in Anki.

Conversely, SRS is least effective if it is your only method of engaging with the material you want to learn. This is especially true if you are using a pre-built deck, since you are missing the process of discovering information and putting it into your own words.
